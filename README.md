# cad11-F20GA
## Aims
The aim of this project is to fulfill the criteria laid out by the F20GA Coursework Specification.
### Excerpt:
      There are three coursework deliverables: 
      1. A high-quality offline rendering of your TV show idea. This deliverable is a rendered image of your scene including four different models, 
      plus any necessary lights, materials and scene structure items.  
      2. A video sequence animation of your  scene. Export  your models (and animation if created in Blender) from the modelling tool into Unreal 
      Engine.  Replace  and  fix  any  pipeline  problems  (e.g.  light  sources,  textures,  positions)  and  animate  a  video  sequence  using  the  Engine, 
      Blueprints and the Sequencer. Save this animation sequence as a video. 
      3. An  interactive  visualiser.  Export  your  objects  from  your  modelling package  into  the  template graphics  API  code,  and  create  an  interactive 
      animation to show an 'alive' scene. You will need to add an exploration camera (moves with keys or has a defined path â€“ not static), simple 
      materials, lights  and keystroke interactions  to  make your scene alive (e.g.  add moving objects, loop interactions, changes in lights,  wind, 
      etc.).

## Theme
The theme of this coursework is to construct the workspace of an Alchemist/Astronomer with light magical elements. This will allow for ample opportunity to create gizmos and the like that do not strictly adhere to physics, but demonstrate a sufficient grasp over the modelling and animation processes.
