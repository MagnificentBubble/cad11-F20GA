## Video Files
Scene_Final.mp4 depicts the full models and materials for the scene Scene_Final.gtfl viewed in Microsoft 3D Viewer.
Pentagon_Animation.mp4 depicts Brass_Pentagon.gltf with animations in Microsoft 3D Viewer.
Pentagon_Application.mp4 depicts Brass_Pentagon.gltf rendered via an executable using the Template code.

## Difficulties
This section of the coursework is imcomplete. This is due to having four concurrent courseworks - including the dissertation - due at roughly the same time. As such, there was very little time to devote to this coursework. Additionally, there was much difficulty in creating the code environment on my home desktop and the use of the GRID lab was required. Due to it being late in the semester, lab availability was low due to weekends and exams.

## Models
The models were exported as GLTF files from Blender. These files were universally broken in some way and required editing. Textures and normal maps were implemented by importing the baked files from the Animation portion of the coursework, wile other parameters were entered as code. Textures and normal maps are found in the Template/assets/textures. Allmodels have robust materials applied as a result, including an emissive material. Attempting to compile the application for any model besides the basic pentagon failed however, becoming stretched out and tangled. There was not enough time to resolve this issue. As such, the video of the final scene in real time was shown via the native windows model viewer.

## Animations
Due to prior animation implementation, new animations were implemented in Blender for export. Few animations were finished due to time constraints.

## Shaders
Shaders were not implemented.

## Lights
Lights were not implemented.

## Interactivity
Interactivity was not implemented.
