#Difficulties
This section of the coursework is very imcomplete. This is due to my having four concurrent courseworks - including the dissertation - due at roughly the same time. As such, thre was very little time to devote to this coursework. Overall, there were only three days to devote to this coursework, with the rest swallowed by more important matters such as health. Additionally, there was much difficulty in creating the code environment on my home desktop and the use of the GRID lab was required. Due to it being late in the semester, lab availability was low due to weekends and exams.

##Models
The models were exported as GLTF files from Blender. These files were universally broken in some way and required editing. Textures and normal maps were implemented by importing the baked files from the Animation portion of the coursework, wile other parameters were entered as code. Textures and normal maps are found in the Template/assets/textures. Allmodels have robust materials applied as a result. Attempting to compile the application for any model besides the basic pentagon failed however, becoming stretched out. There was not enough time to resolve this issue. As such, the video of the final scene in real time was shown via the native windows model viewer.

##Animations
I realized too late into the project that unreal animations would be able to be exported as GLTF files. As such, new animations were implemented in Blender for export. Few animations were finished in time.

##Shaders
Shaders were not implemented.

##Lights
Lights were not implemented.

##Interactivity
Interactivity was not implemented.
